## Advanced Logic Design
- Contemporary design of finite-state machines as system controllers using FPGA devices.
- Minimization techniques, performance analysis, and modular system design.
- HDL simulation and synthesis.
- **Laboratory**: Design, construction, and testing of controllers from verbal specs. Use of CAD design tools.
